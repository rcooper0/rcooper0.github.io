			              <p>Git is a VCS (version control system) created by Linus Torvalds in 2005 for Linux. It is used as a way of tracking the changes in files on computers and keeping track of these files when being worked on by a number of people. Now it is used as a type of source code management during the process of developing software. The "Hub" portion is meant to be used as a repository hosting service allowing access to a multitude of users granting them the ability to collaborate with anyone that has access to a computer and the internet. GitHub was created by Chris Wanstrath, PJ Hyett, and Tom Preston-Werner in February of 2008. I can see this site being very convenient and really useful in my future. It's a really thoughtful concept.
